    <h1>About</h1>
    
<br><br>
<p>This website is designed to explore how animals interpret human voice, where human speech is translated to text. The voice is not transcribed flawlessly to show how animals are not reacting to the meaning of words, but rather to how it sounds (the tone). The custom fonts/typography underscore animals’ alertness to human voice: owls use a simplistic font to reveal their silent focus at night; tigers use bold, glitchy fonts to suggest its vigilance; and deers (and lamb) use light, fragile fonts to show its quick to flee.
<br><br>
The homepage has a digital painting I created, depicting motionless animal sculptures waiting for the user to click their individual names (e.g. owls), which would take you to their webpage. There are 3 animal webpages available now, and with more to come in the future. 
<br><br>
The user will interact by talking to the animal on each webpage. There are instructions and information on the top of each animal webpage. The viewer can say any words/sentences, and then see how the animals would respond. Animals are always aware of human voice, where they would either prey or avoid capture.
<br><br>
I found through making this website that it poses an emotional question. I learned that a loud voice can be unsettling for an animal, raising the question of how much volume, audibility, and tone affects how we judge the intention behind a person’s message in society today. This also leads me to ponder what voices are read as aggressive or emotional even when they are not.
